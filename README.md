# AstroVoid-Android-Game
A space-themed android game created using the Unity game engine. This is the first programming project I ever undertook. It is published on the Google Play Store and can be downloaded through the following link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Devorrin.AstroVoid

Update (January 23, 2024): The game is currently unavailable but I am hoping to have it updated and online again very soon.

Key features of the project include:
  - Google Play Integraiton (Achievements, Leaderboards)
  - Monetization (In-App Purchases, Unity Ads)
  - Hierarchical Programming (System and subsystem managers)
  - Homemade sprites and feature art
  
The app utilizes the Google Play API to manage its Play Store Integration and is able to log data, save player states, and check for internet connectivity. The storyline and tutorial are originally crafted with hopes of giving the user a unique experience.

I hope you enjoy!
